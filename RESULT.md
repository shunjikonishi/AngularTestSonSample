## Change log
- Change jasmine to mocha
- Add travis ci co-operation
- Add slack co-operation
- Write a service test
- Write a controller test
- Write a protractor test

## Knowledge
- How to use karma
  - Maybe controller test is not suitable to karma
  - Where should I put $httpBackend ? -> Each service test.
- What is protractor
- What is API first
- I like this project's naming rule.
  - e.g. xxxx.controller.js, xxxx.spec.js
  - Because I have too many files which have same name in current project.

## Next
- I hope protractor meetup!
